Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets and proper formatting:

```typescript
// ... [previous code remains the same until the Generate Final Report button] ...

                    className="btn bg-accent-gold text-black"
                  >
                    Generate Final Report
                  </button>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CreateReportPage;
```

The main issues fixed were:

1. A missing closing bracket `>` for one of the "Generate Final Report" buttons
2. Removed a duplicate button implementation
3. Added proper closing tags and brackets for the nested JSX elements

The file now has proper syntax and all elements are properly closed.
